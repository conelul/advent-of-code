# Advent of Code!

This is a simple compilation of my [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com) solutions **in Python**.

## Dependencies

Dependencies can be found in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) (requires browser-cookie3 to find AoC cookie for automatic submission, but isn't necessary for execution if you set the  cookie in ```~/.config/aocd/token``` yourself).

## License
